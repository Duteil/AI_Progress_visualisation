# AI_Progress_visualisation
An analysis of the progress in AI over the past decades, as well as the number of actors pushing the field forward over time.
This project was conducted as part of a work trial at Epoch AI, using their own data set. 
Results include:
- Interest in AI research has considerably increased over time, particularly starting in the early 2010's.
- Vision projects have received more attention than the other types of projects considered, but interest in language related AI has been increasing in recent years.
- Although academic research has been dominating the field in terms of impactful publication until the mid-2010's, most ground-breaking research now comes from industry actors.
- The number of actors was mostly constant until 2006, with an average of two independent actors publishing very impactful research every year. Since 2006 however, the number has been increasing at a speed of 1.34 more papers being published by independent actors.
